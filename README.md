# Strings
## Theory;
A string is a class that defines objects that be represented as a stream of characters.In the case of strings, memory is allocated dynamically. More memory can be allocated at run time on demand. As no memory is preallocated, no memory is wasted.
#### Syntax:
char str[] = "Hello World!";
